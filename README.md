# Dell Exx50 Hackintosh

[![OpenCore Version](https://img.shields.io/badge/OpenCore-0.6.8-green.svg)](https://github.com/SkyrilHD/Dell-Exx50-Hackintosh/)
### This repo contains all the fixes for Exx50 on macOS Big Sur.

### I need a confirmation if the EFI is working on other models, so I can complete my list. Thanks!

I noticed that my E7250 has nearly the same specs as other Exx50 models, so this repo was created. This will NOT replace the E7250 repo.

Tested on:

Model | Latitude E7250
------------- | ---------------
CPU | Intel Core i5-5300U
GPU | Intel HD Graphics 5500
RAM | 16GB DDR3 1600Mhz
Storage | SK hynix SC210 mSATA 128GB
WiFi | Intel Dual Band Wireless-AC 7265 (only Bluetooth does work with this EFI)
GSM/LTE | Sierra Wireless AirPrime EM7305 (DW5809e)
Software | macOS 11.2.3 Big Sur

## EFI Compatibility list:

Exx50 model | Supported? | Additional notes
:----------: | :----------: | :----------:
13 7350 | _Yes_ | 2
E7450 | **Yes** | -/-
E7250 | **Yes** | -/-
E5550 | **Yes** | 1
E5450 | **Yes** | -/-
E5250 | _Yes_ | -/-
E3550 | _Yes_ | 1
E3450 | _Yes_ | -/-

Bold: confirmed working

Italic: not confirmed

1: disable your dGPU (if you have one) with a SSDT

2: make sure to change your SMBIOS to MacBook8,1

Disclaimer: The list was created based on the specs. Please correct my mistakes

## How to Install macOS Big Sur

There are two ways you can install Big Sur:

1. If you have an already working macOS, download the Installer from the App Store and make a bootable Installer with `createinstallmedia` by using this command in Terminal: `sudo /Applications/Install\ macOS\ Big\ Sur.app/Contents/Resources/createinstallmedia --volume /Volumes/MyVolume`

2. If you are using Windows, use [macrecovery.py](https://github.com/acidanthera/OpenCorePkg/tree/master/Utilities/macrecovery) from the offical [OpenCore release package](https://github.com/acidanthera/OpenCorePkg/releases/). Follow this [guide](https://dortania.github.io/OpenCore-Install-Guide/installer-guide/winblows-install.html) to understand how it works.

After you have created a bootable Installer, copy the EFI folder to the EFI partition and install as usual. After the installation, mount the EFI partition of the installed OS and copy the EFI folder to its partition.

If you want an OOTB-WiFi: You need to change your WiFi card in order for your internet to work. Buy it on eBay or your trusted website and find a suitable card with the kexts.
